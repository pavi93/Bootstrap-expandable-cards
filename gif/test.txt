"VTX, which stands for 'Version Transition Xcelerator,' is a specialized tool engineered to simplify and expedite the upgrading process for both CP (Critical Patch) and JP (Java Platform) updates. This tool is designed to efficiently handle the often complex and time-consuming tasks associated with these upgrades, making the transition to new versions of software smoother and more automated."

The tools employ a staggered approach, where the modification of PP (Primary Purpose) applications takes place incrementally. Subsequent modifications to other applications depend on the success of the changes made to the PP apps.
